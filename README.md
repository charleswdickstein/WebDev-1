# "USE MARK DOWN SYNTAX TO MAKE IT LOOK NICE." -Professor Bloomberg


[LINK TO WEBSITE](https://github.com/jezen/is-thirteen)

This is a link to an open-source github repository that focuses on checking if a number is 13. I find it intersting, because sometimes I'm not sure if a number is 13 or not. Also This open source repo is simple and even beginner programmers to contribute.
